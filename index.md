# RSE International Survey

The Research Software Engineering (RSE) International Survey is a survey conducted
by the UK [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk) since 2016 and now comprises 8 countries
and covers all aspects of the practice of research software engineering.

We ran the **first survey in 2016**, which provided an insight into the
demographics, job satisfaction, and practices of research software engineers
(RSEs) in the UK. To support and broaden this work, the institute will conduct the survey
at regular intervals and extend the geographical coverage to
facilitate inter-country comparisons. The results of the surveys, anonymised
and open licensed, will act as a a valuable resource to
understand and improve the working conditions for RSEs.

In **2017** we also surveyed Canadian RSEs and we added four countries,
Germany, Netherlands, South Africa and USA. Our thanks to our partners: Scott
Henwood (Canada), Stephan Janosch and Martin Hammitzsch (Germany), Ben van
Werkhoven and Tom Bakker (Netherlands), Anelda van der Walt (South Africa) and
Daniel Katz and Sandra Gesing (USA).

Since **2018** we have worked differently and created a survey for all countries
(rather than one survey for each one).

This site covers the **2022** survey results.

## Composition of the survey

The [base questions](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey/blob/master/survey_creation/2018/questions.csv) for the survey were tailored to meet the requirements of each country. They covered ten subjects:
   1. **Demographics**: traditional social and economic questions, such as gender, age, salary and education.
   1. **Coding**: how much code do RSEs write, how often, and for whom.
   1. **Employment**: questions about where RSEs work and in which disciplines.
   1. **Current contract**: understanding stability of employment by questioning the type of employment contract RSEs receive.
   1. **Previous employment**: understanding routes into the profession the reasons for choosing it.
   1. **Collaboration and training**: who RSEs work with, how many people they work with, and the training they conduct.
   1. **Publications**: do RSEs contribute to publications and are they acknowledged?
   1. **Sustainability and tools**: testing, bus factor, technical handover. Also which tools they are using
   1. **Job satisfaction**: what do RSEs think about their job and their career?
   1. **Network**: how do RSEs meet and gain representation?
These subjects are not necessarily  investigated under this order, neither published with that order.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the analysis on your computer, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey-analysis
cd international-survey-analysis
python -m venv venv  # use python3 if your default python is still Python 2
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then change to the year you wish to reproduce: `cd 2018`. First, the
overview and sampling file needs to be run which does some initial processing
for the other sections:

```bash
python overview_and_sampling.py
```

This should create a `cache/processed_data.csv` file. Once this is generated, you can run any of the sections in any order:

```bash
python <section>.py
```

or generate all the sections
```bash
sh ../make_report.sh
```

This utilises the template file found in
[analysis/templates](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey-analysis/tree/main/templates)
corresponding to the section. The template file uses the
[Mustache](https://mustache.github.io) templating languages via the
[chevron](https://pypi.org/project/chevron/) module.
